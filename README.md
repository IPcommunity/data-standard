# Data formats

## What we have now?
During the discussions on the software and data roundtable on the 7th IP workshop, we collect existing data formats and their benefits and drawbacks. The discussions included but not limited to the following formats (".dat, .tx2, .ohm, .dip, .Data, .dcp, .qui)
## A "venn diagram" of the formats
We also collected "all" the requirements for a unified data format, that contains all the information necessary to work with different inversion algorithms, that can be used by the community as a standard.

# Outcome
We decided that the IP community needs one standard for support data collection, and we hope that we can **ALL** make that happen **FINALLY!!**
